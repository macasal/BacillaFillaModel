# BacillaFilla model

Implementation of BacillaFilla model in Netlogo using ODEs. BacillaFilla is a type of bacteria designed to produce "concrete" in the building cracks when they are exposed to light

The model is interactive and holes can be created manually to observe how they become closed due to the "glue" produced by the bacteria
